stackable.info
==============

A web based, web content editor, that lands squarely in the WYM camp.
Objectives are to allow an admin to enforce markup structure on content, and give editors the freedom to create any "in-bounds" content.

stackable.js is a jquery plugin that also used underscore.js

What You Mean (WYM) is not WYSIWYG, although, you will get what you meant.
