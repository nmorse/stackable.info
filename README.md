Stackable.info
==============

Stackable.info is a web based content editor, that is devoted to the importance of content and its structure.
Objectives are to allow an admin to enforce markup structure on content, 
and give editors the freedom and ease to create any content that is within that 
prescribed structure.

Stackable.info is not a WYSIWYG editor, because although a WYSIWYG editor may make content look good, the structure 
of the content is hidden from the editor, and the markup often takes a circuitous route to achieve the visual 
arrangement of text.

The Tact that Stackable.info takes is to be upfront with the editor and enable them to easily create "in-bounds" 
content. Separation of content style, from its' structure is built into Stackable.info...
