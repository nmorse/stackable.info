Stackable.info
==============

Stackable.info is a web based content editor, that is devoted to the importance of content and its structure.
Objectives are to allow an admin to enforce markup structure on content, 
and give editors the freedom and ease to create any content that is within that 
prescribed structure.

Stackable.info is not a WYSIWYG editor, because although a WYSIWYG editor may make content look good, the structure 
of the content is hidden from the editor, and the markup often takes a circuitous route into overly nested tags in order to achieve the visual 
arrangement of content.

The Tact that Stackable.info takes is to be upfront with the editor by showing them their content's structure, and 
enable them to easily create "in-bounds" content. Stackable.info champions a separation of "style," from "structure" 
to make content editing rational activity. 

A Graph of Tag Structure
------------------------

The structure of the tags that you deem to be "in-bounds" are specified with a graph of tags and the 
parent/child relations between them. Each node of a "tag-structure graph" represents an HTML tag, and 
each edge delineates the acceptable relations between them.
