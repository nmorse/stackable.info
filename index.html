<h1>Stackable.info</h1>
<p class="lead">"Nested in a stack of information, stackable.info 
wrangles text into well-formed content."</p>
<p>Stackable.info is a rich text editor that clearly displays the 
structure of your content.<br/> 
An administrator defines the allowable 
<a href="#structured_content" >HTML structures</a> and how they may be 
nested.<br/>
An editor is easily able to structure their content using any allowable 
markup (HTML) structures. The editing environment then offers only 
acceptable structures at any given nesting level, and always enforces 
well-formed content.<br/>
The benefit is that Editors are given the freedom to concentrate on 
creating content, without having to be concerned about markup 
structural continuity or validity.<br/>
</p>

<h2>Demonstration</h2>
<div id="demo1">
<h2>H1 Test</h2>
<p>paragraph1 text</p>
<ul><li>first</li><li>second</li><li>third</li></ul>
<h2>H2 Test</h2>
<p>paragraph2 testing paragraph2 testing paragraph2 testing paragraph2 
testing paragraph2 testing paragraph2 testing paragraph2 testing 
paragraph2 testing  paragraph2 testing paragraph2 
testing paragraph2 testing paragraph2 testing paragraph2 testing... </p>
<ul><li>one</li>
    <li>two
        <ul><li>a</li><li>b</li><li>sea</li></ul>
    </li>
    <li><p>three ... a paragraph inside an li tag is ok</p>
        <ul><li>x</li><li>y</li><li>zzzz</li></ul>
        <p>and another paragraph inside this li tag is ok... 
        <em>after</em> the list</p>
        or just plain text inside the li tag like this...
    </li></ul>
</div>
<div id="stackable_control_panel"></div>
<h3>Tag Graph</h3>
<div id="graph_vis">
</div>
<p>(in the graph above) The Tags and connections between them are 
used to ensure that the editor allows only "in-bounds" markup structure.</p>
<!-- end of demo content -->

<h2 class="topic configuration">Configuration</h1>
<p class="topic">The way it works can be configured through a graph of 
tags. The tag graph maps out all allowable combinations of nested tags. 
The tag graph can allow liberal nesting of tags, or it can limit the 
nesting of tags that enforces content form.
The way it looks can be changed via CSS.
</p>
<p class="topic">The allowable tag graph is a graph structure (of nodes 
and edges) representing the possible tags or containers for your 
content (represented as nodes), and the relationships between these 
tags, which are allowed inside each (represented as edges).
</p>

<h2 class="topic not_wymsiwyg">Not WYSIWYG</h1>
<p class="topic">The "What You See Is What You Get" editor has been so 
commonly used over the last decades, but the unseen markup produced has 
been haphazard and unintentionaly sloppy. 
The truth about WYSIWYG editors is that they produce "out-of-Bounds" 
HTML structures, the likes of: lists inside of paragraphs; paragraphs 
inside of span tags; etc.

 The problem is that the structure of the content is a 
complete mystery (and largely invisible) to the person editing. For 
instance, the section of text in a WYSIWYG editor gives no indication 
of what markup structures are involved. 
As a result, moving or copying content may cause tag fragments to 
propagate, resulting in convoluted markup that degrades as successive 
editors edit content.
As markup gets further from what is intended, WYSIWYG editors
may even trap a user into a state of 
"What You See Is What You Are Stuck With."
</p>
<p>
It is a disservice to allow an editor to blindly alter markup structures
 and inadvertently contort content based only on the markup rendering. 
</p>
<p>
Although, not all WYSIWYG editors are bad, mixing of content and style 
together is not ideal. Separation of content and style is what Web 
developers have been trying to achieve for years. Separating these 
concerns and enforcing (your definition of) acceptable nested 
structures, is what stackable.js may be used for.
</p>

<h2 class="topic FIS">Freedom Inside Structure</h1>
<p class="topic"> All HTML editing environments have the common goal of 
protecting the user from the exacting details of correctly coding 
markup by hand. 
And the less training that you have to do, the better. For a content 
editor, "Coding Markup" is a distraction from the crafting good 
content, so unless they coders at heart, teaching markup is outside of 
their core task.
</p>
<p>The Stackable.info way is to provide the correct amount of structure 
and to let the content creation flow (freely) within that structure. 
After all, WYSIWYG editors have had their decade and now people want a 
UX that clearly displays that previously hidden structure of their 
content.
