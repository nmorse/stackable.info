<h1 class="url-jingle">Stackable.info</h1>
<p class="tag-line">"Nested in a stack of information."</p>
<p>Stackable.info is a rich text editor that clearly displays the structure of your content.<br/> 
The programmer defines the allowable <a href="#structured_content" >HTML structures</a> and how they may be nested.<br/>
The editors are easily able to structure their content using any allowable HTML structures. The editing environment only offers acceptable structures at any given nesting level, and always enforces well formed content.<br/>
The benefit is that Editors are given the freedom to concentrate on creating content, without having to be concerned about HTML structural continuity or validity.<br/>
</p>

<h2>Demonstration</h2>
<div id="demo1">
<h2>H1 Test</h2>
<p>paragraph1 text</p>
): opps this text is not allowed directly inside a div... :(
<ul><li>first</li><li>second</li><li>third</li></ul>
<h2>H2 Test</h2>
<p>paragraph2 testing paragraph2 testing paragraph2 testing paragraph2 testing paragraph2 testing paragraph2 testing paragraph2 testing paragraph2 testing paragraph2 testing paragraph2 testing paragraph2 testing paragraph2 testing paragraph2 testing paragraph2 testing paragraph2 testing paragraph2 testing paragraph2 testing paragraph2 testing paragraph2 testing paragraph2</p>
<ul><p>Trouble here, to have this paragraph inside a ul tag</p> and likewise trouble as well to have a "text node" inside this ul tag 
    <li>one</li>
    <li>two
        <ul><li>a</li><li>b</li><li>sea</li></ul>
    </li>
    <li><p>three ... a paragraph inside an li tag is ok</p>
        <ul><li>x</li><li>y</li><li>zzzz</li></ul>
        <p>and another paragraph inside this li tag is ok... <em>after</em> the list</p>
        or just plain text inside the li tag like this...
    </li></ul>
</div>
<div id="stackable_control_panel"></div>

<h2 class="topic configuration">Configuration</h1>
<p class="topic">The way it works can be configured through a graph of tags. The tag graph maps out all allowable combinations of nested tags. The tag graph can allow liberal nesting of tags, or it can limit the nesting of tags that enforces content form.
The way it looks can be changed via CSS.
</p>
<p class="topic">The allowable tag graph is a graph structure (of nodes and edges) representing the possible 
tags or containers for your content (represented as nodes), and the relationships between these tags, which are allowed inside each (represented as edges).

<h2 class="topic not_wymsiwyg">Not WYSIWYG</h1>
<p class="topic">A long time ago, In an effort to spend more time at the beach, people invented "What You See Is What You Get" editor user interfaces.
But while the programmers were at the beach, users were creating unintended "out-of-Bounds" HTML structures, the likes of: lists inside of paragraphs; paragraphs inside of span tags; and paragraphs inside of paragraphs.
And since this was before the time of cellphone towers near beaches, the support calls piled up. The problem was that the structure of the content was a 
complete mystery (and completely invisible) to the person editing, and when they selected some section of text, they had no indication that their selection might be in a list or a paragraph, or a bit of both. 
They just wanted to move it down lower or copy it to another section, so they did, 
and that is when the trouble started, copied tag fragments and all. The HTML code that a WYSIWYG editor produces is often convoluted, and continues to degrade as successive editors
blindly select HTML structures and contort them into what they would like to see. But without knowing any better, they were allowed to make html that got further from what they intended.
Sometimes trapping a user into a state of "What You See Is What You Are Stuck With."</p>
<p>
Okay, so not all WYSIWYG editors are bad, but mixing of content and style together is never good. Separation of content and style is what Web developers have been trying to do for years. So, if you're goal is to separate these concerns and enforce your definition of acceptable nested structures, then stackable.js may help.
</p>

<h2 class="topic FIS">Freedom Inside Structure</h1>
<p class="topic"> All HTML editing environmets have the 
common goal of protecting the user from the exacting details of correctly coding HTML by hand. 
And the less training that you have to do, the better. Coding Markup is always a distraction from the crafting good content, so unless 
they coders at heart, teaching markup is outside of their core task.
</p>
<p>So the Stackable.info way is to provide a little structure (or a lot) and let the content flow (freely) within that structure. 
After all, since the Wild West and WYSIWYG editors did not turn out to be as romantic as they claim, what we need to get back to is: more time at the beach.
